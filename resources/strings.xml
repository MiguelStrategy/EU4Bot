     the first being the current game session and the later being from a previous session,

    <unknown_error>Unknown Error. Possible causes: 

    -> the skanderbeg links aren't from the same game
    -> you wrote the links backwards\n->you entered the wrong tag, if that was the case\n->you set a non colonial nation as a colony ('C')
    
    Please if you are having this error and dont know why, contact me on discord (Rubense#6711) for further detail</unknown_error>

    <formation_error> is not present in the previous save
    most likely it was formed by another tag
    Please insert the tag that formed it, if this is a colony or you are having problems with this enter 'C' instead of the tag </formation_error>

    <permission_error>I do not have permissions to write in that channel, please retry the command with a valid Channel ID</permission_error>
